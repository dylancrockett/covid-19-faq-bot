    "What is a novel coronavirus?": "A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the\u00a0coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans\u00a0and cause mild illness, like the common cold.",
    "Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?": "On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced\u00a0an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, \u2018CO\u2019 stands for \u2018corona,\u2019 \u2018VI\u2019 for \u2018virus,\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as \u201c2019 novel coronavirus\u201d or \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d.\nThere are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.",
    "How does the virus spread?": "\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 most commonly spreads between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet, or 2 arm lengths).\nIt spreads through respiratory\u00a0droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes.\n\nThese\u00a0particles can be inhaled into the nose, mouth, airways, and lungs and cause infection.\u00a0This is thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nDroplets can also land on surfaces and objects and be transferred by touch. A person may get COVID-19 by\u00a0touching the surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. Spread from touching surfaces is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\n\nIt is possible that COVID-19 may spread through the droplets and airborne particles that are formed when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes.\u00a0There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond 6 feet (for example, during choir practice, in restaurants, or in fitness classes). In general, indoor environments without good ventilation increase this risk.\n\nCOVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (\u201ccommunity spread\u201d) in\u00a0many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.",
    "Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?": "It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.\u00a0 There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.",
    "What is community spread?": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. For information on community spread in your area, please visit your health department\u2019s website.\u200b",
    "Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?": "At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. See\u00a0How Coronavirus Spreads\u00a0for more information.",
    "How can I protect myself?": "Visit the How to Protect Yourself & Others\u00a0page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19.",
    "Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?": "Wear masks in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\nCOVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.\nThe masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.\nMore information about masks can be found on our masks site.\n\nHow to Wear\nHow to Wash\nHow to Make\n\n",
    "Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?": "\n\nIt is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness.\nContinue your medications,\u00a0and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.\nContinue to manage your disease\u00a0the way your healthcare provider has told you.\nHave at least a 2-week supply\u00a0of all prescription and non-prescription medications.\nTalk to your healthcare provider about whether your vaccinations are up-to-date.\nCall your healthcare provider\n\nif you have any concerns\u00a0about your medical conditions, or if you get sick.\nto find out about different ways you can connect with your healthcare provider for chronic disease\u00a0management or other conditions.\n\n\nDo not delay getting emergency care for your health problems or\u00a0any\u00a0health condition that requires immediate attention.\n\nIf you need emergency help, call 911.\nEmergency departments have infection prevention plans to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need care for your medical condition.\n\n\nContinue to practice everyday prevention. Wash your hands often, avoid close contact, wear a mask, cover coughs and sneezes, and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces often.\n\nFor more information, see Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness.",
    "Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?": "There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nLearn more about safe handling of deliveries and mail.",
    "Is it okay for me to donate blood?": "In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.",
    "Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?": "\n\nCurrently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.\nContact lens wearers should continue to\u00a0practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits\u00a0to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.\nPeople who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.\n\nFind more information about\u00a0how coronavirus spreads\u00a0and\u00a0how to protect yourself.\nVisit\u00a0CDC\u2019s contact lens website\u00a0for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.",
    "Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?": "\n\nHydrogen peroxide-based systems\u00a0for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nFor other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.\n\n\nAlways use solution\u00a0to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present.\nHandle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.\n\nFind more information about\u00a0how coronavirus spreads\u00a0and\u00a0how to protect yourself.\nVisit\u00a0CDC\u2019s contact lens website\u00a0for more information on healthy contact lens wear and care.",
    "Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?": "Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.",
    "What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?": "Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.\u00a0 If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See CDC\u2019s recommendations\u00a0for household cleaning and disinfection.",
    "What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick?": "Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.\u00a0CDC has directions\u00a0for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:\n\nStay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.\nUse a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\nProvide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.\nClean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.\n\nHowever, some people may need emergency medical attention. Watch for symptoms and learn when to seek emergency medical attention.\nWhen to Seek Emergency Medical Attention\nLook for\u00a0emergency warning signs*\u00a0for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs,\u00a0seek emergency medical care\u00a0immediately\n\nTrouble breathing\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\nNew confusion\nInability to wake or stay awake\nBluish lips or face\n\n*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.\nCall 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility:\u00a0Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.",
    "What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?": "\n\nStay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19.\nBe alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms\u00a0of COVID-19.\nIf possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.\n\n",
    "What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?": "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (\u201casymptomatic\u201d). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain underlying medical conditions\u00a0and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).\nFor more information for parents or caregivers of children, see Children and Teens\u00a0 and the COVID-19 Parental Resources Kit.\nFor more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see How COVID-19 Spreads.",
    "Should children wear masks?": "In general, children 2 years and older should wear a mask. However, CDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some children, such as children with certain disabilities, including cognitive, intellectual, developmental, sensory and behavioral disorders. Learn more about what you should do if your child or you cannot wear masks in certain situations.",
    "What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)?": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition associated with COVID-19 where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. For information, see MIS-C.",
    "Can my child hang out with their friends during the pandemic?": "The more people your child interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. While your child may spend time with other people when they return to childcare or school settings, reducing the number of people your child interacts with outside people within your household, childcare facility or school can reduce the risk of getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC recommends children 2 years of age and older wear a mask\u00a0in public settings or when around people who do not live in their household, especially when it is difficult to stay at least 6 feet from others. However, masks should not be a substitute for other preventive measures such as frequent hand washing and staying at least 6 feet away from others.\nFor more information, see Help Stop the Spread of COVID-19 in Children and considerations for Daily Activities.",
    "Can my child spend time with older adults and people with chronic medical conditions?": "Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions\u00a0are at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19.\n\nIf you live with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider separating your child from them if your child has frequent interactions with those outside the household (like at schools or other settings).\nConsider postponing visits or trips to see grandparents, older family members, or family members with underlying medical conditions while there are high levels of transmission (or high number of COVID-19 cases) in your community.\nIf your child does visit someone who is older or has an underlying medical condition that puts that them at risk of severe illness, your child should stay at least 6 feet away from that person. If your child is 2 years or older, he or she should also wear a mask.\nTake steps to help protect your child from COVID-19 in order to reduce the risk of your child spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others especially people at increased risk of severe illness.\n\n",
    "My child has an underlying medical condition. What additional steps should my family take?": "People of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions\u00a0might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. In addition to following the recommendations to prevent getting sick, families can take steps recommended for children with underlying conditions.\n\nConsider identifying potential alternative caregivers, in case you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers should not be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 For more information, see Sick Parents and Caregivers. Make sure these caregivers take extra precautions if your child has a disability.\nIf your child receives any support care services in the home, such as services from personal care attendants, direct support professionals, or therapists, make plans for what you will do if your child\u2019s direct care providers or anyone in your family gets sick. You can review CDC\u2019s recommendations for Direct Service Providers.\n\nFor more information, see Children and Teens and Others who Need Extra Precautions.",

However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone.\nIf you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\nFor more information about viral tests, please visit Test for Current Infection.",
    "How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean?": "Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.\nA positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.\nHaving antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.\nYou should continue to protect yourself and others\u00a0since you could get infected with the virus again.\nIf you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.\nRegardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\nIf you want more information about antibody tests, see Test for Past Infection.",
    "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?": "Yes, it is possible.

A negative result before end of the 14-day quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. By self-quarantining for 14 days, you lower the chance of possibly exposing others to COVID-19.",
    "I was recently around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel fine. Why should I stay at home?": "People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they don\u2019t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the fight against COVID-19 and helps protect you, your family, and your community.",
    "What if I have been around someone who was identified as a close contact?": "If you have been around someone who was identified as a close contact to a person with COVID-19, closely monitor yourself for any symptoms of COVID-19. You do not need to self-quarantine unless you develop symptoms or if the person identified as a close contact develops COVID-19.",
    "Will there be a national app for contact tracing?": "No, there will not be a national app for contact tracing. There are many options available now, and it is up to each state and individual to decide which tools best fit their needs.",
    "If I participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 using a digital tool, is my personal health information secure?": "Yes, if you agree to participate in contact tracing for COVID-19 with the health department, your information is secure.\nDiscussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. Your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19.\nHealth departments may use case management tools to help make the contact tracing process more efficient. If you choose to provide information through one of these tools, your information is secure and stored with the health department. These tools also help health departments quickly receive and analyze information about COVID-19. Case management tools are under the same laws and regulations for all sensitive health information use (e.g. HIPPA). You must provide consent for the health department to collect information using a case management tool. Just like traditional contact tracing, digital tools will not collect information regarding money, Social Security numbers, bank account information, salary information, or credit card numbers.\nExposure notification tools may be an app that you can download on your personal cell phone. If you choose to download an exposure notification app for COVID-19, your information is secure. Exposure notification apps are developed in collaboration with or endorsed by health departments. These apps undergo rigorous testing to determine their trustworthiness, security, and ability to protect people\u2019s privacy. Until you give consent to share information with your local health department, any information you have entered into the app is stored only on your personal phone. Your information is stored only on your own phone and is not sent to the health department or any other third party. The app and your information can be deleted any time. When you consent to share your information with the local health department, your information is secure.",
    "Will I be required to download a contact tracing app for COVID-19 on my phone?": "No, you are not required to download an app to give information for contact tracing for COVID-19. Health departments commonly use case management tools to make the contact tracing process more efficient. These types of tools are not downloaded on personal cell phones.\nIf you choose to give information to your local or state health department for contact tracing for COVID-19, you do not need to download an app on your cell phone. The health department staff may call you to\n\nCheck on your health,\nDiscuss who you have been around, and\nAsk where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others.\n\nIt is up to you to decide if you download an exposure notification app for COVID-19.",
    "Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?": "There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. However, you may be at risk of getting COVID-19 if you attend a funeral where there are multiple people congregating. For more information about what you can do to help protect yourself and others from COVID-19 during these services, and to help cope with the loss of a loved one, see Funeral Guidance.",
    "What should loved ones know about handling belongings and the body of someone who died from COVID-19?": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread\u00a0from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is infected with the virus. The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.\nThis type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. If the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. For more information on recommended precautions while handling the belongings and the body of someone who died from COVID-19, see Funeral Guidance.",
    "Do car seats and booster seats need extra cleaning and disinfection to prevent spread of COVID-19?

CDC recommends cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and frequent handwashing or the use of hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol as best practice measures for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses.\nSome cleaning and disinfectionexternal icon products are not recommended for use on car seats and booster seats. Owners should follow the manufacturer\u2019s cleaning instructions for their car seats and booster seats.\nMotor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children in the United States. Always buckle children in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, and seat belts when riding in a vehicle.",
    "What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?": "Cleaning\u00a0with soap and water or a detergent removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading\u00a0infection.\u00a0Disinfecting with a household disinfectant\u00a0on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2external icon\u00a0kills germs on the surface. By disinfecting or killing germs on a surface after cleaning the surface, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. For more information review cleaning and disinfection recommendations for facilities and homes.",
    "Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with COVID-19 was there?": "The risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming.\nConsider removing area rugs completely, if possible, to reduce the need for cleaning, disinfection, and vacuuming.\nIf vacuuming is necessary or required,\n\nFirst, follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities.\nClose off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.\nAfter cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming:\n\nUse a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.\nDo not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms.\nTemporarily turn off in-room, window-mounted, or on-wall recirculation HVAC to avoid contamination of the HVAC units.\nDo NOT deactivate central HVAC systems. These systems tend to provide better filtration capabilities and introduce outdoor air into the areas that they serve.\n\n\n\n",
    "What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19?": "Routine cleaning is everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally do to maintain a healthy environment.\nSurfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned and disinfected with soap and water or detergent. These surfaces should be cleaned at least daily when facilities are in use.\nMore frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use.",
    "Who should clean and disinfect facilities?": "Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect facilities. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and\u00a0provided\u00a0with, and wear, masks\u00a0and the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for all of the chemicals used.",
    "How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light?": "The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the\u00a0surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. However, CDC is producing guidance on use of Germicidal ultraviolet as an alternative disinfection method. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.

While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater.\nStandard practices associated with wastewater treatment plant operations should be sufficient to protect wastewater workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. These standard practices can include engineering and administrative controls, hygiene precautions, specific safe work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required when handling untreated wastewater. No additional COVID-19\u2013specific protections are recommended for workers involved in wastewater management, including those at wastewater treatment facilities.\nSee Information for Wastewater and Sanitation System Workers on COVID-19 for additional information.",
    "If my utility has issued a Boil Water Advisory, can I still use tap water to wash my hands?": "In most cases, it is safe to wash your hands\u00a0with soap and tap water during a Boil Water Advisory. Follow the guidance from your local public health officials. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
    "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through floodwater?": "\nThere is\u00a0no evidence that COVID-19 can spread to people through water, including floodwater.\nSometimes floodwater can mix with\u00a0wastewater. CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person.\u00a0Stay out of floodwater to\u00a0avoid hazards and illnesses\u00a0from contaminants that are not associated with COVID-19.

    "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds?": "CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds. Plus, proper operation of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus.\nThe virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public pool, hot tub, or water playground is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:\n\nStay home if you are infected or might be infected\u00a0with the virus that causes COVID-19.\nStay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don\u2019t live with.\nWear cloth masks\u00a0when not in water.\nCover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.\n\nSee Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds\u00a0for more information.",
    "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools?": "CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation\u00a0of public pools (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools.\nIn traditional pools, chlorine products (such as granules or liquid bleach) are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt (made up of sodium and chloride) is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools.",
    "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in lakes, oceans, or rivers?": "CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers, or other natural bodies of water.\nThe virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public beach or other swim area in a natural body of water is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:\n\nStay home if you are infected or might be infected\u00a0with the virus that causes COVID-19.\nStay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don\u2019t live with.\nWear cloth masks\u00a0when not in water.\nCover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Learn more about healthy swimming in natural bodies of water and access water quality information by state.",
    "Can cloth masks be worn in the water?": "No, do NOT wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be difficult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don\u2019t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to stay at least 6 feet apart\u00a0in the water from people you don\u2019t live with.\nIn case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second (or extra) cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public pool or beach.",
    "Can Lycra (Spandex or elastane), the cloth used to make swimsuits, be used to make cloth masks?": "CDC does not yet have evidence on the effectiveness of different types of cloth materials.\nWearing cloth masks\u00a0can help prevent people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading the virus. Make sure your cloth mask:\n\nfits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face,\ncompletely covers the nose and mouth,\nis secured with ties or ear loops,\nincludes multiple layers of fabric,\nallows for breathing without restriction, and\ncan be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.\n\nCloth masks should NOT be worn by children less than 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

    "How many people, visitors and staff, can be in and around a public pool, hot tub, or water playground (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) at the same time?": "The design of the public pool, hot tub, or water playground and surrounding deck and if visitors live together or not will affect how many people can stay at least 6 feet apart\u00a0from those they don\u2019t live with.\nCDC recommends operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds:\n\ncomply with local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal regulatory agency policies and requirements on gathering (so the number of swimmers in the water isn\u2019t more than the maximum allowed) and\nteach and reinforce social (physical) distancing\u00a0among visitors and staff.\n\nOperators might want to limit the number of people in and around the water so if the water needs to be evacuated (because of lightning or other health or safety threat) social distancing can be maintained on the deck. Otherwise, if the water is evacuated and social distancing cannot be maintained on the deck, close the deck to visitors. There is no standard formula to determine how many people can maintain social distancing in the water and on the surrounding deck.\nSee Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds\u00a0for more information.",
    "Can I use pool, hot tub, or water playground water to disinfect surfaces or shared objects?": "No. Only List N disinfectants approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon\u00a0should be used to disinfect surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles).\nThe list includes hundreds of disinfectants. Operators of public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) should consult with the design company or engineer to determine which disinfectants are best suited for surfaces and with manufacturers to determine which disinfectants are best suited for shared objects.\nRemember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them\u00a0and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants.",
    "Can the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) light disinfect surfaces and shared objects?": "We don\u2019t know yet. Early scientific data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun\u2019s UV light. However, the ability of the sun\u2019s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles) needs more research. Factors \u2014 such as cloudiness, latitude (distance from equator), time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun\u2019s UV light \u2014 will determine how effectively the virus is inactivated.\nRemember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectantsexternal icon.",
    "How often do surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) at public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to be cleaned and disinfected?": "The more frequently a surface is touched by multiple people, the more frequently it should be cleaned and then disinfected with a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily.\nRemember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them\u00a0and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants.",
    "Do procedures for responding to formed fecal (poop) or diarrheal incidents in public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) need to change during the COVID-19 pandemic?": "No. RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in feces (poop). While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in feces. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces from an infected person. As a result, CDC has not changed its fecal incident response recommendations. Remember, do NOT vacuum feces out of the water.",
    "Can lifeguards monitor how visitors socially distance (stay at least 6 feet apart from people you don\u2019t live with), wear cloth masks, or wash hands?": "Not when lifeguards are actively lifeguarding. Lifeguards actively lifeguarding should not be doing other tasks that could distract them. Drowning deaths have resulted, at least in part, from lifeguards being distracted.\u00a0\nDrowning can occur quickly and quietly. Learn and take steps to prevent drowning.",
    "How can the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 be slowed during lifeguard training?": "Lifeguard trainers can consider the following steps to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19:\n\nHave the virus? Stay home to save lives.\n\nEducate instructors, lifeguard students, and others about when they should stay home to isolate (if they have symptoms of COVID-19 or tested positive for COVID-19) or quarantine (if they have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19) and when they can return or reschedule training.\nConduct daily health checks (see frequently asked question on screening) or ask instructors, students, and others to conduct self-checks (such as temperature screening or symptom checking), if possible.\n\nConduct health checks safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal privacy and confidentiality laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n\n\n\nBe smart, stay at least 6 feet apart\n\nConduct knowledge training virtually or online, when possible, to limit contact among instructors, students, and others.\nTeach and reinforce social (physical) distancing\u00a0during in-person skills training in and out of the water \u2014 maintaining at least 6 feet between people who don\u2019t live together.\n\nProvide physical cues or guides (such as lane lines in the water or chairs and tables on the deck) and visual cues (such as posted signs or tape on the deck).\n\n\nLimit close contact, particularly face-to-face interactions, between people who don\u2019t live together, as recommended by the lifeguarding-certifying organization. Such as\n\nAquatic rescue\n\nFor practice rescues\n\nHave each student practice rescues on his or her household member instead of another student.\n\n\nFor actual rescues\n\nStress the need to keep the number of people involved in rescue and resuscitation to the minimum number needed to provide proper care.\nStress the need to 1) perform rescues from the deck (using an extending or throwing device) if conditions allow and 2) if possible, have people on the deck wear cloth masks, when removing victim from the water because social distancing cannot be maintained. If an in-water rescue is needed, minimize exposure to the distressed swimmer\u2019s face without protection, if possible approaching him or her from behind.\n\n\n\n\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)\n\nFor practice resuscitation\n\nLimit student-to-manikin ratio and student-to-automated external defibrillator (AED) training device ratio to 1:1. Have each student use his or her own breathing barrier when doing rescue breathing on a manikin.\n\n\nFor actual resuscitation\n\nStress the need for and train with personal protective equipment (PPE) during resuscitation, as recommended by the CPR-certifying organization (such as the American Red Crossexternal icon), and use a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. BVM ventilation is best delivered with two rescuers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWear a mask. Save lives.\n\nTeach and reinforce use of cloth masks\u00a0in public settings when around people you don\u2019t live with, particularly when it is difficult to maintain social distancing.\n\nAdvise people wearing masks to not wear them in the water. Cloth masks can be difficult to breathe through when they\u2019re wet. This means it is particularly important to maintain social distancing in the water. Plus, wet cloth masks don\u2019t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks.\n\n\n\n\nCover coughs and sneezes\n\nTeach and reinforce covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.\n\n\nWash hands often\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing\u00a0with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being in a public place or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n\nUse hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water are not readily available.\n\n\n\n\nClean and then disinfect\n\nClean and then disinfect surfaces frequently touched by multiple people (such as door handles, light switches, and tables). Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon\u00a0as per label instructions.\nClean and then disinfect all shared equipment that is not disposable (such as manikins and rescue tubes) between users. Use cleaning product and a List N disinfectant approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon\u00a0as per label instructions. Consult with manufacturers to decide which List N disinfectants are best for equipment.\n\n\n\nCDC has more COVID-19\u2013related considerations for public pools and public beaches and non-COVID-19\u2013related healthy and safe swimming resources."
